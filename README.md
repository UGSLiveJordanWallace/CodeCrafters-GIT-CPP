This is a starting point for C++ solutions to the
["Build Your Own Git" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/git).

In this challenge, you'll build a small Git implementation that's capable of
initializing a repository, creating commits and cloning a public repository.
Along the way we'll learn about the `.git` directory, Git objects (blobs,
commits, trees etc.), Git's transfer protocols and more.

## Due to a paywall, I was not able officially finish the project.
The Features that I have implemented are down below:
> Object Read/Write
> Tree Read/Write
> Commit Read/Write
